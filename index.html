  <h1>Hollow Wood &ndash; Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 13 November 2025</p>

  <p>
    Hollow Wood is a Twitch Extension that allows viewers to play a mini-game, earn levels and skins,
    and compete on channel and global leaderboards. This Privacy Policy explains what information we
    receive, how we use it, and the choices you have.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Receive</h2>

  <h3>Identity Information</h3>
  <p>When you use Hollow Wood on Twitch, the extension may receive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Twitch User ID</strong> &ndash; only if you choose to share your identity with the extension</li>
    <li><strong>Twitch Opaque ID</strong> &ndash; if you do not share identity (this does not reveal who you are)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Gameplay &amp; Usage Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Channel ID</strong> where the extension is running</li>
    <li>Your <strong>game scores</strong> and your <strong>best score per channel</strong></li>
    <li>Your <strong>weekly free-play usage</strong> (how many free plays you have used this week)</li>
    <li>Progression data such as <strong>level, XP, prestige</strong>, total games, and cosmetic skin selections</li>
    <li><strong>Bits transaction IDs</strong> processed by the extension (for example, for paid plays)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What We Do <em>Not</em> Collect</h3>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Email address</li>

    <li>Payment information</li>
    <li>Twitch password</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Chat messages</li>
    <li>Any personal information not explicitly listed above</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use This Information</h2>
  <p>Your information is used only to operate the Hollow Wood extension, including to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Display your scores on <strong>channel and global leaderboards</strong></li>
    <li>Track and enforce <strong>weekly free-play limits</strong></li>
    <li>Manage <strong>progression</strong>, such as XP, level, prestige, and cosmetic unlocks</li>
    <li>Process <strong>Bits-based plays</strong> and prevent duplicate use of the same transaction</li>
    <li>Provide <strong>testing/VIP features</strong> for broadcasters (when enabled)</li>
    <li>Improve or maintain extension functionality</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your information with advertisers or unrelated third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Hollow Wood stores and processes data using the following trusted services:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Twitch API services</strong> (for identity, display names, and extension authentication)</li>
    <li><strong>Supabase</strong> (database and secure storage)</li>
    <li><strong>Hosting provider</strong> used for the extension&rsquo;s backend (for example, Render or a similar service)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These services store data securely and only as needed for the operation of the extension. We do not
    share your personal information with any other third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Gameplay and progression data may be stored for as long as the Hollow Wood extension is active.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may request deletion of your data at any time (see Section 7). Upon request, your data will be
    permanently removed from our database within <strong>30 days</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>
    All communication between the extension and our backend uses <strong>HTTPS encryption</strong>. Stored data is
    protected using <strong>Supabase&rsquo;s database security controls</strong> and industry-standard safeguards.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only minimal data required for gameplay is collected. While no online system is 100% secure, reasonable
    measures are taken to protect data against loss, misuse, or unauthorized access.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Hollow Wood is <strong>not directed to children under the age of 13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect data
    from anyone under 13 years old.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you believe data has been collected from someone under 13, please contact us and we will delete it
    promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>

  <h3>Identity Sharing</h3>
  <p>
    You may choose not to share your Twitch identity with the extension. In that case, Hollow Wood uses a
    non-identifying <strong>opaque ID</strong>, and certain features (such as named leaderboards or skin
    progression) may be limited.
  </p>

  <h3>Stopping Use</h3>
  <p>
    You can stop using the extension at any time by closing or disabling it on Twitch.
  </p>

  <h3>Requesting Data Removal or Access</h3>
  <p>
    You may request a copy of the data stored about you, or request deletion of your data, by contacting
    the developer directly (see Section 8).
