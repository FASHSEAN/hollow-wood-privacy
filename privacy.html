  <h1>Hollow Wood – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: <13 November 2025 --></em></p>

  <p>
    Hollow Wood is a Twitch Extension that lets viewers play a mini-game and compete on channel and global leaderboards.
    This policy explains what information the extension receives and how it is used.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Receive</h2>
  <p>When you use Hollow Wood on Twitch, the extension may receive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Twitch <strong>User ID</strong> (if you choose to share your identity with the extension)</li>
    <li>Your Twitch <strong>Opaque ID</strong> (if you do not share identity)</li>
    <li>The <strong>Channel ID</strong> of the channel where the extension is running</li>
    <li>Your <strong>game scores</strong> and best score per channel</li>
    <li>Your <strong>weekly free-play usage</strong> (how many free runs you have used this week)</li>
    <li>Bits <strong>transaction IDs</strong> used in the extension (for example, retries or plays unlocked with Bits)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> receive your password, email address, payment details, or any chat messages through this extension.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use This Information</h2>
  <p>Your data is used to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Save and display your score on channel and global leaderboards</li>
    <li>Track and enforce weekly free-play limits</li>
    <li>Detect and prevent duplicate processing of the same Bits transaction</li>
    <li>Optionally grant special/VIP access to certain users (where configured by the broadcaster)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The information is only used for Hollow Wood gameplay and leaderboards. It is not sold, rented or shared with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Scores and related usage data are stored in a database managed by the developer of Hollow Wood. Data may be kept for
    as long as the extension is active or until it is no longer needed for gameplay and leaderboards.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    Communication between the Twitch client and the Hollow Wood backend uses HTTPS. While no online service can be
    completely secure, reasonable technical measures are taken to protect stored data against accidental loss or
    unauthorised access.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You may choose <strong>not</strong> to share your Twitch identity with the extension. In that case, the game may
      use a non-identifying opaque ID and certain features (such as named leaderboards or VIP access) may not be available.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can stop using the extension at any time by closing or disabling it on Twitch.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this policy or would like to request removal of data associated with your account,
    please contact the developer at:
